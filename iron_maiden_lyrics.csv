If Eternity Should Fail,"Here is the soul of a man Here, in this place, for the taking Clothed in white, stand in the light Here is the soul of a man Time to speak with the shaman again Conjure the jester again Black dog in the ruins is howling my name So, here is the soul of a man When the world was virgin Before the coming of men Just a solar witness The beginning of the end From a world of magma To a cold rock face The ascent of madness And a human race We are strange believers, all of us There are stranger truths, immortal lust We rise from slumber, he calls our name Recalls our number, abide with pain Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line for the ending of time If eternity should fail Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line for the ending of time If eternity should fail To god’s illusion which I recall Was our delusion Before the fall The angels come and the angels go But the lord of light shining below Eternal blackness beyond the stars We think our wisdom will get that far At the master’s table, the table’s bare No land of plenty, devastation, despair Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line for the ending of time If eternity should fail Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line at the ending of time If eternity should fail Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line for the ending of time If eternity should fail Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line at the ending of time If eternity should fail Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line at the ending of time If eternity should fail Reef in a sail at the edge of the world If eternity should fail Waiting in line at the ending of time If eternity should fail Good day my name is  NecropolisI am formed of the deadI am the harvester of the soul meat And I suck the lives from around my bed My own two sons, I gave them breath And I filled their living corpses with my bile What humanity I knew, I have long forgotten For me, eternity is nothing But a short while"
Speed Of Light,"Another time, another placeA hollow universe in spaceI took a trip to see the sightsI will be blacker than the night One way ticket, no return My shootin' star so fast it burns On the edge that you can't see Let's shoot the moon, you and meI'm not particular, you see Just a lonesome galaxy Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us At the speed of light Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us We slip into the night I'll say a mass for you and wave Shootin' plasma from my grave Event horizon lost in space Runnin' in a human raceI don't know where, I don't know when But somehow, back there time againI'm on the edge that you can't seeI’m not particular at nightA single particle of me You won’t be tracking me by sight Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us At the speed of light Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us We slip into the night Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us At the speed of light Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us We slip into the night Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us At the speed of light Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us We're slipping into the night Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us At the speed of light Shadows in the stars We will not return Humanity won't save us We slip into the night"
The Great Unknown,Winter softly falling to the ground Calmly waiting don’t you hear a sound When the world has fallen to the depths below Where the future’s open and the fear has grown And the path to follow to the great unknown Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown In the selfish hearts of some The nightmare’s coming With the spilling blood of others Now wringing through Now the cup is spilling over Wake to news of death And the prophecy of sages Destiny is met To the depths of human mind The cry is burning With the mentor’s anger Of the lesson ringing true And for those who live by and are dying by the sword They will take their ideals with them Justify their end Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying Where the wolves are preying On the weak alone Where the sons are dying Hear their mothers crying And the distant sound of fire Begins again Never ending the desires of men It’ll never be the same or calm again In a time of changing hearts And great unknown It’ll be the damnation and end of us all Where the fools are lying And the meek are crying Where the wolves are preying On the weak alone Where the sons are dying Hear their mothers crying And the distant sound of fire begins again Never ending the desires of men It’ll never be the same or calm again In a time of changing hearts And great unknown It’ll be the damnation and end of us all When the world has fallen And we stand alone
The Red And The Black,The morals of life and the perils of death Take the wrong way out running out of breath Meet my match in the afterlife Suppress the demons that plague the nightA tortured mind is a safe place to go But the truth lurks down in the dark below Step inside my inquisitive mind Are you scared at what you just might find See myself in the hall of mirrorsA different shape every step I takeA different mind every step of the line But in the end they are all mine Laughing sorrow inside your head Can’t get out just a feeling of dreadI know this burden's a heavy loadA dark mistake never ending road The black jack king and the red queen clash The artful dodger he counts his stash The joker’s wild like an impish child While madame fortune she waits inside The good luck charm is overkill The tired old soldier says fire at will Planes overhead go search destroy The ones below human decoy I need somebody to save me Meanwhile we play the waiting game The clock is struck the horse is lame And when we think that this is done Chance your luck a four leafed one You hedge your bets the battle lost To wait in vain and count the cost The thin edged line Between good and bad And cast the luck be happy sad I need somebody to save me The red and the black People don’t want the truth Look in their eyes and you send them away The red and the black Fate and hypocrisy Burden’s a heavy load there is no doubt The red and the black All out of luck again How many chances can anyone have? The red and the black Treachery out to win There in the wrong place and at the wrong time I need somebody to save me

Shadows Of The Valley,"Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow Walking in a dark world that’s been Kissed with sadness Without sunlight, things are born To the dead of nightmares Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness Listen closely to the raven’s call Praying hard for our world not to end Try as might to make sense of it all Will it be for the penance of men Follow north for the call of the wild Look all out for a small wayward child Lay in fear as the dark raven crows Look for guidance from the one who knows He lived on this earth for a time and a half Playing a tune to the old man’s laugh The fear that’s inside the men of the oath In the script of the book that he wrote Ask them the questions Tell them no liesA cry for freedom Praying that they wouldn’t die Mind over matter Cry over sins Their lives are over now Ended before they begin As the raven again passes byI can hear all the wake fathers cry That the first born of all men will die That their lives will be taken from them Face the danger, a battle of wills Strength and courage, a cure for all ills We believe in that thou shall not kill But others are ready to spill The hearts of all men since beginning of time Living with temptation Wanting and crimeA walk in the shadow of the valley of death Knowing I’ll take my last breath Ask them the questions Tell them no liesA cry for freedom Praying that they wouldn’t die Mind over matter Cry over sins Their lives are over now Ended before they begin The hearts of all men since beginning of time Living with temptation Wanting and crimeA walk in the shadow of the valley of death Knowing I’ll take my last breath Ask them the questions Tell them no liesA cry for freedom Praying that they wouldn’t die Mind over matter Cry over sins Their lives are over now Ended before they begin Into the valley of death fear no evil We will go forward no matter the cost Into the valley of death, follow me now Bring me your souls and I’ll make it our last Ask them the questions Tell them no liesA cry for freedom Praying that they wouldn’t die Mind over matter Cry over sins Their lives are over now Ended before they begin"
Tears of a Clown,"All alone in a crowded room He tries to force a smile The smile it beamed or so it seemed But never reached the eyes, disguise Masquerading as the funny man do they despise The false smile, maketh of the man Glass empty or half full Try to make some sense or sorrows drown All looks well on the outside Underneath, the solemn truth There’s something that inside has died Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes But the cloud remains the same Wonder why he’s feeling down Tears of a clown Maybe it’s all just for the best Lay his weary head to rest Was forever feeling drowned Tears of a clown Who motivates the motivator? Facade it has to go He knows, it sooner or later Smile for cameras, all okay But tomorrow is another day, he must get through He had a longer way to run Or so the story goes Life full of fun, where did it go? We saw the sadness in his eyes It came as no surprise And now, of course, we’ll never know Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes But the cloud remains the same Wonder why he’s feeling down Tears of a clown Maybe it’s all just for the best Lay his weary head to rest Was forever feeling drowned Tears of a clown Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes But the cloud remains the same Wonder why he’s feeling down Tears of a clown Maybe it’s all just for the best Lay his weary head to rest Was forever feeling down Tears of a clown, tears of a clown Tears of a clown, tears of a clown"
The Man Of Sorrows,"Like a man without a home Watching people come and go Carry on their daily lives Without a thought for the ones alone Cast the dream aside like throwingA pebble into the ocean tide And I’m feeling so alone again Free the angry from their pain Free the captives from the chains Cast aside the doubt that Nothing good can come their way again Living in a world of lies No matter how or hard we try Living life without a dream today Looking through a mist of truth That we believe an elusive cloud The things we find are hard to say now That we live through day to day Find it hard to force the reasons Why we find it hard to die Now, we need to know the truth now Open our eyes that we can see So we live and breathe again Better days for you and me Can we even hope to deliver this? We are so far away As one turns against the other With a brother against brother Situation like no other it’s a picture of despair As we look to see the man of sorrows Passing knowledge to those who don’t know As we watch all our friends passing over As they pass through the edges of time And we see what’s ahead that awaits us That no longer do we feel afraid So we look to see the man of sorrows And the light is the darkness, no more As we look to see the man of sorrows Passing knowledge to those who don’t know As we watch all our friends passing over As they pass through the edges of time And we see what’s ahead that awaits us That no longer do we feel afraid So we look to see the man of sorrows And the light is the darkness, no more"
Empire Of The Clouds,"To ride the storm to an empire of the clouds To ride the storm they climbed Aboard their silver ghost To ride the storm to a kingdom that will come To ride the storm and damn the rest Oblivion Royalty and dignitaries,  Brandy and cigars Grey lady giant of the skies You hold them in your arms The millionth chance, they laughed To take down his  Majesty’s craft"" To  India"", they say, "" Magic carpet float away"" An  October fateful day Mist is in the trees Stone sweats with the dew The morning sunrise, red before the blue Hanging at the mast, waiting for command His  Majesty’s airship, the R101 She’s the biggest vessel built by manA giant of the skies For all you unbelievers, the  Titanic fits inside Drum roll, tight her canvas skin, silvered in the sun Never tested with the fury, with the beating yet to come The fury yet to come In the gathering gloom The storm rising in the west The coxswain stared Into the plunging weather glass We must go now We must take our chance with fate We must go now For a politician, he can’t be late The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch But the ship is in their backbone Every sinew, every inch She never flew at full speed, a trial never done Her fragile outer cover her  Achilles would become An  Achilles yet to come Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed Loyal to the king and an airship creed The engines drum, the telegraph sounds Release the cords that bind us to the ground Said the coxswain:“ Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight“ Said the captain:“ Damn the cargo, we’ll be on our way tonight“ Groundlings cheered in wonder As she backed off from the mast Baptizing them her water from the ballast fore and aft Now, she slips into our past Fighting the wind as it rolls you Feeling the diesels that push you along Watching the channel below you Lower and lower into the night Lights are passing below you Northern  France asleep in their beds Storm is raging around you""A million to one"", that’s what he said Reaper standing beside her With his scythe, cuts to the bone Panic to make a decision Experienced men asleep in their graves Her cover is ripped and she’s drowning Rain is flooding into the hull Bleeding to death and she’s falling Lifting gas is draining away “ We’re down lads“, came the cry Bow plunging from the sky Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die The flares to guide her path, ignited at the last The empire of the clouds Just ashes in our past, just ashes at the last Here lie their dreams as I stand in the sun On the ground where they built and the engines did run To the moon and the stars Now, what have we done? Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on Dreams live on, dreams live on Now a shadow on a hill The angel of the east The empire of the clouds May rest in peace And in a country churchyard Laid head to the mast Eight and forty souls Who came to die in  France"

The Talisman,"When I stand and look About the port And contemplate my life, will  I Ever see my countrymen again? As the captain calls us on the deckI take my things and walk To the harbourside, I glance back One last time Fleeing our nation, our problems We leave behind Ships by the tenfold sail Out on the tide We are pleased to be out and Embracing the open sea Free from our troubles And more free from thee Inheritors unfulfilled reason Behind us We flee from what is not what Is will be We flee the earth and face our Harsh reality Will death be low mist that Hangs on the sea? We run from the evil tongues, rash Judgements, selfish men Never to be seen on these Shores again As we sail into oceansize And lose sight of all landA face of contentment Around in the air We're off now to Seek all our fortunes To the land of our dreams Riding the waves and the storm Is upon us The winds lash the sails but The ropes keep them tight Off in the distance a dark cloud Approaching None could imagine what there Was to come No, there's no one going back No, there's not a second chance As we strap onto the side We pray to  God that we don't die As we ride the rough seas As we soak from the ocean wavesI just hope for all our lives And pray that I survive Four ships are lost in the Stormy conditions The spirits of the sunken crews Their phantoms follow us Spirits, sails, they drive us on Through the all consuming waves Cold mortality, no weapon Against these ever raging seas Four leagues and ten and we Hit storms again We just can't get away from The eye of the storm The birds outsoar the raging storm But we cannot escape it Abandoned earth that we Now crave Is many leagues from safe Holding on for our dear lives And we're praying once again Rotten luck or just jonahed? The talisman is in my hand Limbs fatigues, trembling with cold Blinded from the sea spray salt Clasping anything we can hold Heaven's rain upon us falls Twenty days without a meal And ten without fresh water still Those that didn't die in storms The scurvy rest did slaughter Westwards the tide Westwards we sail on Westwards the tide Sail by the talisman We approach the other side Of the ocean with the tide In our favour just for once Welcome greeting, our new land The elation in our hearts The excitement in our veins As we sail towards the coastline Of our golden promised land Weary limbs fatigued awayI have no life left in me No more strength and nothing Left to give Must find the will to live Never thought that we could Make it Truly sight of shores divine The sickness I am dying from Never wanted it to end this way Westwards the tide Westwards we sail on Westwards the tide Sail by the talisman"
The Man Who Would be King,"As he travels on the beast of burden Moving up along the mountainside As he gazes looking down the valley No regrets but his pride As he journeys across mountain passes And significant sweeps over him His reflection of the beauty around him Feeling empty inside He is running from his wildest thoughts He is running from his everything He is looking now to find something Hoping he can be saved He's searching for the answer now It's something that he's managed to avoid up 'till now Real conviction that he craves He needs to find the answer sooner or later Pushed himself to the limits He had to strive for all the harder things in life But what the cost to giving now His life his, time are the only things that he has Life is not a rehearsal All he has is the one chance to get it right Living really is the only way to know Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done But now the pain of lying too early in the grave Destiny no good to hide away Penance now will be his only way Understand, no good to run away Penance now, we'll be his saving grace He tries to make his peace with  God All is forgivable but he's left a little late Trying something that he's not Is impossible to change such a lot He's taken someone's life away There's not a day that goes by, he regrets what he's done He should have found another way But the good book says an eye for an eye In reflecting on decisions that were made On the judgements that will haunt him 'till his grave No one has the right to take another life But in his mind he had no choice, so be it Destiny, no good to hide away Penance now, will be his only way Understand, no good to run away Penance now, we'll be his saving grace Destiny, no good to hide away Penance now, will be his only way Understand, no good to run away Penance now, we'll be his saving grace Far, far away The man who would be king Far, far away The man who would be king So far way The man who would be king So far way The man who would be king Far, far away The man who would be king"
When The Wild Wind Blows,"Have you heard what they said on the news today Have you heard what is coming to us all? That the world as we know it will be coming to an end Have you heard, have you heard? He sees them in the distance where the darkened clouds roll He can feel tension in the atmosphere He would look in the mirror, see an old man now Doesn't matter they survived somehow They said there's nothing can be done about the situation They said there's nothing you can do at all To sit and wait around for something to occur Did you know, did you know? As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows And wonders if they'll ever grow again The desperation of the situation getting graver Getting ready when the wild wind blows Have you seen what they said on the news today Have you heard what they said about us all Do you know what is happening to just every one of us?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day He's getting tired; that'll do for now They are preparing for the very worst to come to them Getting ready when the wild wind blows He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down Upside down He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face, Saying ""grace"" Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind Left behind And a lifetime spent together long ago Will be gone They've been preparing for some weeks now For when the crucial moment comes To take their refuge in the shelter Let them prepare for what will come They make a tea and sit there waiting They're in the shelter feeling snug Not long to wait for absolution Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait Can't believe all the lying, All the screens are denying That the moments of truth have begun Can't you see it on the t.v.? Don't believe them in the least bit Now the days of our ending have begun Say a prayer when it's all over Survivors unite all as one Got to try and help each other Got the will to overcome I can't believe all the lying, All the screens are denying That the moments of truth have begun Can't you see it on the t.v.? Don't believe them in the least bit Now the days of our ending have begun When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other The tins of poison laying nearby their clothes The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fall out, Just another when the wild wind blows..."

The Legacy,"Tell you a thing That you ought to know Two minutes of your time Then on you go Tell tale of the men All dressed in black That most of them Not coming back Sent off to war To play little games And on their return Can't name no names Some strange yellow gas Has played with their minds Has reddened their eyes Removed all the lies And strange as it souns Death knows no bounds How many get well? Only time will tell Only time will tell You lie in your death bed now But what did you bring to the table? Brought us only holy sin Utter trust is a deadly thing To the prayer of holy peace We didn't know what was lying underneath So how could we be such fools And to think we tought you the answer I can't begin to understand in all the lies But on your death bed I can see it in your eyes Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow It really makes sense I can see it clearly now Tangled up in a web of lies Could have been away to prophesise Unaware of the consequence Not aware of the secrets that you kept Nothing that we could believe To reveal the facade of faceless men Not a thing that we could foresee Not a sign that would tell us the outcome You had us all strung out with Promises of peace But all along your cover plan was to deceive Can it put to rights now?  Only time will tell Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well Left to all our golden sons All to pick up on the peace You could have given all of themA little chance at least Take the world to a better place Given them all just a little hope Just think what a legacy You know will leave We seem destined to live in fear And some that would say armageddon is near But while there's a life or there's hope That man won't self destruct Why can't we treat our fellow men With more respect and a shake of their hands But anger and loathing is rife The death on all side is Becoming a way of life We live in a uncertain world Fear understanding and ignorance Is leading to death Only the corpses are left For voltures that pray on their bones But some are just not wanting peace Their whole life is death and misery The only thing that they know Fight fire with fire, life is cheap But if they do stop to think That man is teetering right on the brink But do you think that they care? They benefit from death and pain and despair"

Dance Of Death,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones About a thing that I saw One night wandering in the evergladesI'd one drink but no more I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight Gazing up at the stars Not aware of a presence so near to me Watching my every move Feeling scared and I fell to my knees As something rushed me from the trees Took me to an unholy place And that is where I fell from grace Then they summoned me over to join in with them To the dance of the dead In to the circle of fire I followed them Into the middle I was led As if time had stopped stillI was numb with fear, but still, I wanted to go And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me As I walked on to the coals Then I felt I was in a trance And my spirit was lifted from me And if only someone had the chance To witness what happened to me And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them All had death in their eyes Lifeless figures they were undead all of them They had ascended from hell As I danced with the dead My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me Below my undead body just danced the circle of death Until the time came to reunite us both My spirit came back down to meI didn't know if I was alive or dead As the others all joined in with me By luck then a skirmish started And took the attention away from me When they took their gaze from me Was the moment that I fled I ran like hell faster than the wind But behind I did not glance One thing that I did not dare Was to look just straight ahead When you know that your time has come around You know you'll be prepared for it Say your last goodbyes to everyone Drink and say a prayer for it When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead To this day I guess I'll never know Just why they let me go But I'll never go dancing no more' Til I dance with the dead"

New Frontier,"Bleeding you dry from the start  The sum of my parts  To give it away  New life in a day  Some new  Frankenstein  Damned for all time  Cursed by the angel who fell  Who saves me from hell?  And who is my god?  And where is my soul?  Too tired to jump too young to run  Neverending forever searching  Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart  Always seeking always asking  Questions right from the start  Out beyond the new frontier  Playing god without mercy without fear  Create a beast made a man without a soul  Is it worth the risk a war of god and man?  Is it worth the risk a war of god and man?  I want to end my life now, but I don't know how  Recycled again a lifetime of pain  The spawn of a man  The devil has planned  Neverending forever searching  Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart  Always seeking always asking  Questions right from the start  Out beyond the new frontier  Playing god without mercy without fear  Create a beast made a man without a soul  Is it worth the risk a war of god and man?  Is it worth the risk a war of god and man?"

Ghost Of The Navigator,"I have sailed to many lands now I make my final journey On the bow I stand, west is where I go Through the night I plough still my heart calculate and pray As the compass swings my will is strongI will not be led astray Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun But I know, I know I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where I go I do not knowI only know the place I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strainI will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind For eternity I follow on there is no other way Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun But I know, I know"

Sometimes takes just more than that To survive be good at heart There is evil in some of us No matter what will, never change I will hope My soul will fly So I will live forever Heart will die My soul will flyI will live forever Just a few small tears between Someone happy and one sad Just a thin line drawn between Being a genius or insane At what age begin to learn Of which way out we will turn?

Cause nothing is fair just you look around Falling down Falling down Falling down He's sick of waiting of lying like this There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss Branded a leper because you don't fit In the land of the free You can live by your wits Once he built missiles a nations defence Now he can't even give birthday presents Across the city he leaves in his wakeA glimpse of the future a cannibal state Falling down Falling down Falling down"
Fortunes Of War,After the war And now that they've sent us homewardI can't help but feel that I'm on my own No one can see just what this conflict has done to The minds of the men who are on their way home I'm scarred for lifebut it's not my flesh that's wounded So how can I face the torment alone The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmaresI lay there and sweat until it gets light People say 'don't worry' Say that time's a perfect healer That the nightmares they will come to pass Can't hear what they're sayingI am living in my own world And I'm feeling trance-like all the time I hear voices in my head Could I really be going crazy In the night the visions seem so real Do you care if you live or die When you laugh are you really crying You're not sure what's real anymore Fortunes of war Fortunes of war Fortunes of warno pain anymore Sometimes I wakeI feel that my spirit's brokenI wonder if I've the strength...carry on carry on
Look For The Truth,All my dark dreams Drift like smoke in the breeze The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep Here comes the nightmare that never ends Here is the dream that makes monsters of men In the house of my soul In rooms of ugliness and cold Memories locked away All the doubts and fears I never faced Now they come againI am falling down to meet with them Fear within us all Mine awake and they stand up tall Look for the truth Deepest cut of all from you Knife of the truth Blade of hatred slicing through I pray my sleep will break Maybe this time I won't wake Weakness I hide so well This dagger in my mind will tell It's my final standI make a fist out of each hand To the shadows of the past Take a breath and I scream attack
The Aftermath,Silently to silence fallin the fields of futile war Toys of death are spitting lead Where boys that were our soldiers bledwar horse and war machine Curse the name of liberty Marching on as if they shouldmix in the dirt our brothers' blood In the mud and rainwhat are we fighting for Is it worth the pain Is it worth dying for Who will take the blame Why did they make a war Questions that come again Should we be fighting at all Once a ploughman hitched his team Here he sowed his little dream Now bodies arms and legs are strewn Where musterd gas and barbwire bloom Each moment's like a yearI've nothing left inside for tears Comrades dead or dying lieI'm left alone asking why In the mud and rainwhat are we fighting for Is it worth the pain Is it worth dying for Who will take the blame Why did they make a war Questions that come again Should we be fighting at all After the war Left feeling no one has won After the war What does a soldier become
Judgement Of Heaven,"A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyoneA silent prayer to  God to help you on your wayI've been depressed so long It's hard to remember when I was happyI've felt like suicide a dozen times or more But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way The hardest part is to get on with your life You're searching in the dark Clutching at straws to find a way You take the  Tarot cards and throw them to the wind Your questions your beliefs,your inner thoughts, your whole existence And if there is a  God then answer if you will And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace If you could live your life again Would you change a thing or leave all the same If you had the chance again Would you change a thing at all When you look back at your past Can you say that you are proud of what we've done Are there times when you believe That the right you thought was wrong All of my life I have believed Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me"
Blood On The World's Hands,Sometimes it makes me wonder Sometimes it makes me question Sometimes it makes me saddened Always it makes me angry but... When you can see it happening The madness that's all around you Nobody seems to worry The world seems to powerless to act...

One day another killing Somewhere there's someone starying Another a savage raping Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us It's out of control Blood on the world's hands Each day it goes on Brutality and aggression Tomorrow another lesson Expecting another air raid Praying for a geaserfire They say things are getting better No need to be complacent There's chaos across the border And one day it could be happening to us It's out of control Blood on the world's hands It's our epitaph It's out of control Someone should know Blood on the world's hands
The Edge Of Darkness,"I've looked into the heart of darkness Where the blood red journey ends When you've faced the heart of darkness Even your soul begins to bend For a week I have been waiting Still I am only in  Saigon The walls move in a little closerI feel the jungle call me on Every minute I get weaker While in the jungle they grow strong What I wanted was a mission And for my sins they gave me one They brought it up just like room service Cause everyone gets what they want And when that mission was all overI'd never want another one I know, captain that you've done this work before We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure The colonel's gone rogue And his methods are unsound You'll take a  P BR up river track him down There's a conflict in every human heart And the temptation is to take it all too far In this war things get so confused But there are some things which can not be excused He's acting like a god an insane lunatic Your mission - exterminate with extreme prejudice The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow Here is the file and it's all you need to know Here I am the knife in my hand And now I understand why the genius must die Now I stand alone in darkness With his blood upon my hands Where sat the warrior the poet Now lie the fragments of a man"

Hallowed Be Thy Name,"I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time' Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole The sands of time for me are running low When the priest comes to read me the last ritesI take a look through the bars at the last sights Of a world that has gone very wrong for me Can it be that there's some sort of error Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream? Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming It's not so easy to stop from screaming But words escape me when I try to speak Tears flow but why am I crying After all I'm not afraid of dying Don't I believe that there never is an end As the guards march me out to the courtyard Somebody cries from a cell:  God be with you If there's a god then why has he let me go? As I walk all my life drifts before me Though the end is near I'm still not sorry Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away Mark my words please believe my soul lives on Please don't worry now that I have goneI've gone beyond to see the truth When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion Hallowed be thy name"

Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil One nightmare ends, another fertile It's getting to me so scared to sleep But scared to wake now, in too deep Even though its reached new heightsI rather like the restless nights It makes me wonder, it makes me think There's more to this, I'm on the brink It's not the fear of what's beyond It's just that I might not respondI have an interest, almost craving But would I like to get too far in? It can't be all coincidence Too many things are evident You tell me you're an unbeliever Spiritualist?  Well me I'm neither But wouldn't you like to know The truth Of what's out there to have the proof And find out just which side You're on Where would you end in heaven or In hell? Help me!  Help me to find my true Self without seeing the future Save me, save me from torturing Myself even within my dreams There's got to be just more to it Than this Or tell me why do we existI'd like to think that when I dieI'd get a chance, another time And to return and live again Reincarnate, play the game Again and again and again"

Stranger In a Strange Land,"Was many years ago that I left home and came this wayI was a young man full of hopes and dreams But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained Sometimes things ain't what they seem No brave new world, no brave new world No brave new world, no brave new world Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky My spirit wanders endlessly Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why Hear me calling, rescue me Set me free, set me free Lost in this place, and leave no trace Stranger in a strange land Land of ice and snow Trapped inside this prison, yeah! Lost and far from home One hundred years have gone and men again they came that way To find the answer to the mystery They found his body lying where it fell on that day Preserved in time for all to see No brave new world, no brave new world Lost in this place, and leave no trace What became of men that started All are gone and their souls departed Left me here in this place So all alone Stranger in a strange land Land of ice and snow Trapped inside this prison! Lost and far from home Stranger in a strange land Land of ice and snow Trapped inside this prison! Lost and far from home"
Deja Vu,"When you see familiar faces, But you don't remember where they're from, Could you be wrong? When you've been particular places, That you know you've never been before, Can you be sure? ' Cause you know this has happened before, And you know that this moment in time is for real, And you know when you feel  Deja vu. ( Chorus) Feel like I've been here before, Feel like I've been here before. Feel like I've been here before, Feel like I've been here before. Ever had a conversation, That you realise you've had before, Isn't it strange? Have you ever talked to someone, And you feel you know what's coming next? It feels pre-arranged. ' Cause you know that you've heard it before, And you feel that this moment in time is surreal,' Cause you know when you feel  Deja vu."
Alexander The Great,""" My son, ask for thyself another kingdom, For that which I leave is too small for thee."" Near to the  East, in a part of ancient  Greece, In an ancient land called  Macedonia, Was born a son to  Philip of  Macedon, The legend his name was  Alexander. At the age of nineteen, he became the  Macedon king, And he swore to free all of  Asia  Minor, By the  Aegian  Sea in 334  BC, He utterly beat the armies of  Persia. Chorus: Alexander the  Great, His name struck fear into hearts of men, Alexander the  Great, Became a legend 'mongst mortal men. King  Darius the third,  Defeated fled  Persia, The  Scythians fell by the river  Jaxartes, Then  Egypt fell to the  Macedon king as well, And he founded the city called  Alexandria. By the  Tigris river, he met  King  Darius again, And crushed him again in the battle of  Arbela, Entering  Babylon and  Susa, treasures he found, Took  Persepolis, the capital of  Persia. Chorus: Alexander the  Great, His name struck fear into hearts of men, Alexander the  Great, Became a god amongst mortal men. A  Phrygian  King had bound a chariot yoke, And  Alexander cut the "" Gordion knot"", And legend said that who untied the knot, He would become the master of  Asia. Hellenism he spread far and wide, The  Macedonian learned mind, Their culture was a western way of life, He paved the way for  Christianity. Marching on,  Marching on. The battle weary marching side by side, Alexander's army line by line, They wouldn't follow him to  India, Tired of the combat, pain and the glory. Chorus: Alexander the  Great, His name struck fear into hearts of men, Alexander the  Great, He died of fever in  Babylon."

2 Minutes To Midnight,"Kill for gain or shoot to maim But we don't need a reason The  Golden  Goose is on the loose And never out of season. Blackened pride still burns inside This shell of bloody treason Here's my gun for a barrel of fun For the love of living death. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The blind men shout let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers, The  Napalm screams of human flames Of a prime time  Belsen feast... Y E AH! As the reasons for the carnage cut their meatand lick the gravy, We oil the jaws of the war machineand feed it with our babies. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The body bags and little rags of childrentorn in two, And the jellied brains of those who remainto put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us alldance to their song, To the tune of starving millionsto make a better kind of gun. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. Midnight... Midnight... Midnight...is all night Midnight... Midnight... Midnight...is all night."

George or you're david and you always killed the beast Times change very quickly And you had to grow up earlyA house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet You'll die as you lived In the flash of a blade In a corner forgotten by no-one You lived for the touch For the feel of the steel One man, and his honour The smell of resined leather The steely iron mask As you cut and thrust and parried at the Fencing master's call He taught you all he never knew To fear no mortal man And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the Screams of evil men You'll die as you lived In the flash of a blade In a corner forgotten by no-one You lived for the touch For the feel of the steel One man, and his honour You'll die as you lived In the flash of a blade In a corner forgotten by no-one You lived for the touch For the feel of the steel One man, and his honour"
The Duellists,"He threw down the glove you made the mistake Of picking it up now you're gone The choosing of guns or fighting with swords The choice of weapons is done He'll tear you apart as soon as you start You know you don't have a chance.

Back In The Village,"Turn the spotlights on the people, Switch the dial and eat the worm, Take your chances, kill the engine, Drop your bombs and let it burn. White flags shot to ribbons, The truce is black and burned, Shellshock in the kitchen, Tables overturned. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. Throwing dice now, rolling loaded,I see sixes all the way. In a black hole, and I'm spinning As my wings get shot away. Questions are a burden And answers are a prison for oneself Shellshock in the kitchen Tables start to burn. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. No breaks on the inside, Paper cats and burning barns, Theres a fox among the chickens, And a killer in the hounds. Questions are a burden And answers are a prison for oneself Shellshock in the kitchen Tables start to burn. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. But still we walk into the valley And others try to kill the inner flame We're burning brighter than beforeI don't have a number, I'M A  N A ME! Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. Back in the villageI'm back in the villageI'm back in the village again."
Powerslave,"Into the  Abyss I'll fall-the eye of  Horus Into the eyes of the night-watching me go Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this  Temple Enter the risen  Osiris-risen again. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death. When I was living this lie- Fear was my game People would worship and fall-drop to their knees. So bring me the blood and red winefor the one to succeed me,for he is a man and a  God-and  He will die too. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death. Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins, Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone.A shell of a man  God preserved-a thousand ages, But open the gates of my  Hell-I will strike from the grave. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death, Slave to the  Power of  Death... Slave to the  Power of  Death..."
Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner See his eyes as he stops one of three Mesmerizes of one of the wedding guests Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea! And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by his spell, and the mariner tells his tale Driven south to the land of the snow and ice To a place where nobody's been Through the snow fog flies on the albatross Hailed in  God's name, hoping good luck it brings And the ship sails on, back to the north Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on The mariner kills the bird of good omen His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves a part of the crime Sailing on and on and north across the sea Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm The albatross begins with its vengeanceA terrible curse, a thirst has begun His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung And the curse goes on and on and on at sea And the thirst goes on and on for them and me Day after day, day after day We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water, everywhere, and all the boards did shrink Water, water, everywhere, not any drop to drink! There - calls the mariner There comes a ship over the line But how can she sail with no Wind in her sails and no tide? See, onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life - wait, but there's two! Death, and she life in death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the mariner And he belongs to her now Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she, life in death She lets him live, her chosen one One after one, by the star dogged moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face, with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down, one by one The curse, it lives on in their eyes The mariner, he wished he'd die Along with the sea creatures But they lived on, so did he And by the light of the moon He prays for their beauty, not doom With heart he blesses them God's creatures, all of them too Then, the spell starts to break The albatross falls from his neck Sinks down like lead, into the sea Then down in falls, comes the rain! Hear the groans of the long dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak, and they're lifeless in their eyes And revenge is still sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on Now the curse is finally lifted And the mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long dead bodies Form their own light and the mariner's left alone And then a boat came sailing towards him It was a joy, he could not believe The pilots boat, his son and the hermit Penance of life will fall onto him And the ship, it sinks, like lead, into the sea And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins The mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell his tale wherever he goes To teach  God's word by his own example That we must love all things that  God made And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man And the tale goes on and on and on"
Where Eagles Dare,"It's snowing outside, the rumbling sound Of engines roar in the night The mission is near, the confident men Are waiting to drop from the sky The  Blizzard goes on, but still they must fly No one should go where eagles dare Bavarian  Alps that lay all around They seem to stare from below The enemy lines a long time passed Are lying deep in the snow Into the night they fall through the sky No one should fly where eagles dare Their closing in, the fortress is near It's standing high in the sky The cable car's the only way in It's really impossible to climb They make their way, but maybe too late They've got to try to save the day The panicking cries, the roaring of guns Are echoing all around the valley The mission complete, they make to escape Away from the  Eagles  Nest They dared to go where no one would try They chose to fly where eagles dare"
Revelations,"""O  God of  Earth and  Altar, Bow down and hear our cry, Our earthly rulers falter, Our people drift and die, The walls of gold entomb us, The swords of scorn divide, Take not thy thunder from us, But take away our pride."" Just a babe in a black abyss, No reason for a place like this. The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain. An easy way for the blind to go,A clever path for the fools who know. The  Secret of the  Hangman ­ the smile on his lips. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. She came to me with a serpents kiss, As the  Eye of the  Sun rose on her lips. Moonlight catches silver tears I cry. So we lay in a black embrace, And the  Seed is sown in a holy place, And I watched and I waited for the  Dawn. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. S O LO Bind us all together, Ablaze with  Hope and  Free. No storm or heavy weather, Will rock the boat you'll see. The time has come to close your eyes, And still the wind and rain. For the one who will be  King, Is the watcher in the  Ring. It is  You."
Flight Of Icarus,"As the sun breaks, above the ground An old man stands on the hill As the ground warms, to the first rays of lightA birdsong shatters the still His eyes are ablazed See the madman in his gaze Fly, on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly touch the sun Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears Looks the old man in the eye As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd In the name of  God my father I fly His eyes seem so glazed As he flies on the wings of a dream Now he knows his father betrayed Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave Fly, on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly touch the sun"

The Trooper,"You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand, there's no turning back The bugle sounds and the charge begins But on this battlefield no one wins The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath As I plunge on into certain death Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh The horse he sweats, with fear, we break to run The mighty roar of the russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the russians fire another round We get so near yet so far away We won't live to fight another day Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We get so close, near enough to fight When a russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger, and I feel the blowA burst of rounds take my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My body's numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear I draw my parting groan Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Still Life,Take a look in the pool and what do you see In the dark depths there faces beckoning me Can't you see them it's plain for all to see They were there oh I know you don't believe me.

Quest For Fire,In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth When the land was swamp and caves were home In an age when prize possession was fire To search for landscapes men would roam Then the tribes they came to steal their fire And the wolves they howled into the night As they fought a vicious angry battle To save the power of warmth and light Drawn by quest for fire They searched all through the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man And they thought that when the embers died away That the flame of life had burnt and died Didn't know the sparks that made the fire Were made by rubbing stick and stone So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts In the search to find another fire To regain the power of light and heat Drawn by quest for fire They searched across the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man Drawn by quest for fire They searched across the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man Drawn by quest for fire They searched across the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man

Run To The Hills,"White man came across the sea He brought us pain and misery He killed our tribes, he killed our creed He took our game for his own need We fought him hard, we fought him well Out on the plains, we gave him hell But many came, too much for  Cree Oh, will we ever be set free?

Gangland,"Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave. You're running today, maybe tomorrow you'll be saved. You pray for daylight to save you for a while. You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile. Dead men - tell no tales, In  Gangland - murder's up for sale. Dead men - tell no tales, In  Gangland - where the jailbirds die. Face at the window leers into your own. But it's only your reflection, still you tremble in your bones. How long can you hide?  How long 'til they come?A rat in a trap but you've got to survive. Once you were glad to be free for a while. The air tasted good and the world was your friend. Then came the day when the hard times began. Now you're alone but alive for how long? A knife at your throat, another body on the pile.A contract to keep and it's service with a smile. Murder for vengeance or murder for gain. Death on the streets or a blacked out jail. Dead men - tell no tales, In  Gangland - murder's up for sale. Dead men - tell no tales, In  Gangland - where the jailbirds die. In  Gangland you tell no tales."
Total Eclipse,"Cold as steel the darkness waits it's hour will come.A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun. Mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life. War babies in the garden of  Eden, Shall turn our ashes to ice. Sunrise has gone freezing up the fires. Sunrise has gone numbing our desires. Around the world the people stop, With terror stricken eyes.A shadow cast upon them all, To crush them like a fly. In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, There's nowhere left to run. The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane. Around the world the nations wait, For some wise word from their leading light. You know it isn't only madmen who listen to fools. Is this the end, the millions cried, Clutching their riches as they died. Those who survive must weather the storm. Gone are the days when man looked down. They've taken away his sacred crown. To be set free, it took so long. It's not journeys' end, it's just begun."
Hallowed Be Thy Name,"I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time' Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole The sands of time for me are running low When the priest comes to read me the last ritesI take a look through the bars at the last sights Of a world that has gone very wrong for me Can it be that there's some sort of error Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream? Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming It's not so easy to stop from screaming But words escape me when I try to speak Tears flow but why am I crying After all I'm not afraid of dying Don't I believe that there never is an end As the guards march me out to the courtyard Somebody cries from a cell:  God be with you If there's a god then why has he let me go? As I walk all my life drifts before me Though the end is near I'm still not sorry Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away Mark my words please believe my soul lives on Please don't worry now that I have goneI've gone beyond to see the truth When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion Hallowed be thy name"

Killers,"You walk through the subway, His eyes burn a hole in your back.A footstep behind you, He lunges prepared for attack Scream for mercy, He laughs as he's watching you bleed. Killer behind you, His blood lust defies all his needs My innocent victims Are slaughtered with wrath and despise, The mocking religion of hatred That burns in the nightI have no-one,I'm bound to destroy All this greed.A voice inside me, Compelling to satisfy me I can see, What a knife's meant to be. You'll never know, How I came to foresee. My faith in believing is stronger Than lifelines and ties, With the glimmer of metal My moment is ready to strike. The death call arises,A scream breaks the still of the night. Another tomorrow Remember to walk in the light. I have found you, And now there is no place to run. Excitement shakes me, Oh  God help me what have I done. Yeah I've done it again! He walks through the subway My eyes burn a hole through your back.A footstep behind you He lunges prepared for attack. Scream for mercy, He laughs as he's watching you bleed. Killer behind you, My blood lust defies all my needs Look out I'm coming for you!"

Over clouds my mind will fly, Forever now I can't think why, My body tries to leave my soul, Is it me? I just don't know. Memories rising from the past, The future shadows overcast.

When you see me floating up beside you, You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you. C H O R US Please take me away, Take me away, So far away. Repeat."

The Clairvoyant,"Feel the sweat break on my brow Is it me or is it shadows that are Dancing on the walls. Is this a dream or is it now Is this a vision or normality I see Before my eyes. I wonder why, I wonder how That it seems that the power is getting stronger Every dayI feel a strength an inner fire But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore There's a time to live and a time to die When it's time to meet the maker There's a time to live but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying. Just by looking through your eyes He could see the future penetrating right In through you mind See the truth and see your lies But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise There's a time to live and a time to die When it's time to meet the maker There's a time to live but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying......and be reborn again?"

2 Minutes To Midnight,"Kill for gain or shoot to maim But we don't need a reason The  Golden  Goose is on the loose And never out of season. Blackened pride still burns inside This shell of bloody treason Here's my gun for a barrel of fun For the love of living death. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The blind men shout let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers, The  Napalm screams of human flames Of a prime time  Belsen feast... Y E AH! As the reasons for the carnage cut their meatand lick the gravy, We oil the jaws of the war machineand feed it with our babies. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The body bags and little rags of childrentorn in two, And the jellied brains of those who remainto put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us alldance to their song, To the tune of starving millionsto make a better kind of gun.

The Talisman,"When I stand and look About the port And contemplate my life, will  I Ever see my countrymen again? As the captain calls us on the deckI take my things and walk To the harbourside, I glance back One last time Fleeing our nation, our problems We leave behind Ships by the tenfold sail Out on the tide We are pleased to be out and Embracing the open sea Free from our troubles And more free from thee Inheritors unfulfilled reason Behind us We flee from what is not what Is will be We flee the earth and face our Harsh reality Will death be low mist that Hangs on the sea? We run from the evil tongues, rash Judgements, selfish men Never to be seen on these Shores again As we sail into oceansize And lose sight of all landA face of contentment Around in the air We're off now to Seek all our fortunes To the land of our dreams Riding the waves and the storm Is upon us The winds lash the sails but The ropes keep them tight Off in the distance a dark cloud Approaching None could imagine what there Was to come No, there's no one going back No, there's not a second chance As we strap onto the side We pray to  God that we don't die As we ride the rough seas As we soak from the ocean wavesI just hope for all our lives And pray that I survive Four ships are lost in the Stormy conditions The spirits of the sunken crews Their phantoms follow us Spirits, sails, they drive us on Through the all consuming waves Cold mortality, no weapon Against these ever raging seas Four leagues and ten and we Hit storms again We just can't get away from The eye of the storm The birds outsoar the raging storm But we cannot escape it Abandoned earth that we Now crave Is many leagues from safe Holding on for our dear lives And we're praying once again Rotten luck or just jonahed? The talisman is in my hand Limbs fatigues, trembling with cold Blinded from the sea spray salt Clasping anything we can hold Heaven's rain upon us falls Twenty days without a meal And ten without fresh water still Those that didn't die in storms The scurvy rest did slaughter Westwards the tide Westwards we sail on Westwards the tide Sail by the talisman We approach the other side Of the ocean with the tide In our favour just for once Welcome greeting, our new land The elation in our hearts The excitement in our veins As we sail towards the coastline Of our golden promised land Weary limbs fatigued awayI have no life left in me No more strength and nothing Left to give Must find the will to live Never thought that we could Make it Truly sight of shores divine The sickness I am dying from Never wanted it to end this way Westwards the tide Westwards we sail on Westwards the tide Sail by the talisman"
Coming Home,"When I stand before you shining in the early morning sun When I feel the engines roar and I think of what we've done Oh, the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye As the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes No creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earthA thousand leagues away, our land of birth To  Albion's land Coming home when I see the runway lights In the misty dawn the night is fading fast Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay Curving on the edge of daylight til it slips into the void Waited in the long night, dreaming til the sun is born again Stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span Just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes Through the dark atlantic; over mounting stormy waves We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earthA thousand leagues away, our land of birth To  Albion's land Coming home when I see the runway lights In the misty dawn the night is fading fast Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay To  Albion's land Coming home when I see the runway lights In the misty dawn the night is fading fast Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay Coming home, far away when I see the runway lights In the misty dawn the night is fading fast Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay"
Dance Of Death,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones About a thing that I saw One night wandering in the evergladesI'd one drink but no more I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight Gazing up at the stars Not aware of a presence so near to me Watching my every move Feeling scared and I fell to my knees As something rushed me from the trees Took me to an unholy place And that is where I fell from grace Then they summoned me over to join in with them To the dance of the dead In to the circle of fire I followed them Into the middle I was led As if time had stopped stillI was numb with fear, but still, I wanted to go And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me As I walked on to the coals Then I felt I was in a trance And my spirit was lifted from me And if only someone had the chance To witness what happened to me And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them All had death in their eyes Lifeless figures they were undead all of them They had ascended from hell As I danced with the dead My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me Below my undead body just danced the circle of death Until the time came to reunite us both My spirit came back down to meI didn't know if I was alive or dead As the others all joined in with me By luck then a skirmish started And took the attention away from me When they took their gaze from me Was the moment that I fled I ran like hell faster than the wind But behind I did not glance One thing that I did not dare Was to look just straight ahead When you know that your time has come around You know you'll be prepared for it Say your last goodbyes to everyone Drink and say a prayer for it When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead To this day I guess I'll never know Just why they let me go But I'll never go dancing no more' Til I dance with the dead"
The Trooper,"You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand, there's no turning back The bugle sounds and the charge begins But on this battlefield no one wins The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath As I plunge on into certain death Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh The horse he sweats, with fear, we break to run The mighty roar of the russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the russians fire another round We get so near yet so far away We won't live to fight another day Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We get so close, near enough to fight When a russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger, and I feel the blowA burst of rounds take my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My body's numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear I draw my parting groan Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"

Can you really tell me what life is? Maybe all the things that you knowthat are precious to you Could be swept away by fate'sown hand We're blood brothers We're blood brothers We're blood brothers We're blood brothers When you think that we've usedall our chances And the chance to makeeverything right Keep on making the sameold mistakes Makes untipping the balance so easy When we're living our lives onthe edge Say a prayer on the book of the dead We're blood brothers We're blood brothers We're blood brothers We're blood brothers And if you're taking a walk throughthe garden of life"
When The Wild Wind Blows,"Have you heard what they said on the news today Have you heard what is coming to us all? That the world as we know it will be coming to an end Have you heard, have you heard? He sees them in the distance where the darkened clouds roll He can feel tension in the atmosphere He would look in the mirror, see an old man now Doesn't matter they survived somehow They said there's nothing can be done about the situation They said there's nothing you can do at all To sit and wait around for something to occur Did you know, did you know? As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows And wonders if they'll ever grow again The desperation of the situation getting graver Getting ready when the wild wind blows Have you seen what they said on the news today Have you heard what they said about us all Do you know what is happening to just every one of us? Have you heard, have you heard? There will be a catastrophe that like we've never seen There will be something that will light the sky That the world as we know it, it will never be the same Did you know, did you know? He carries everything into the shelter, not a fuss Getting ready when the moment comes He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two Good to have because you never know They tell us nothing that we don't already know about They tell us nothing that is real at all They only fill us with the stuff that they want Did you know, did you know? He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day He's getting tired; that'll do for now They are preparing for the very worst to come to them Getting ready when the wild wind blows He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down Upside down He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face, Saying ""grace"" Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind Left behind And a lifetime spent together long ago Will be gone They've been preparing for some weeks now For when the crucial moment comes To take their refuge in the shelter Let them prepare for what will come They make a tea and sit there waiting They're in the shelter feeling snug Not long to wait for absolution Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait Can't believe all the lying, All the screens are denying That the moments of truth have begun Can't you see it on the t.v.? Don't believe them in the least bit Now the days of our ending have begun Say a prayer when it's all over Survivors unite all as one Got to try and help each other Got the will to overcome I can't believe all the lying, All the screens are denying That the moments of truth have begun Can't you see it on the t.v.? Don't believe them in the least bit Now the days of our ending have begun When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other The tins of poison laying nearby their clothes The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fall out, Just another when the wild wind blows..."

Afraid To Shoot Strangers,"Lying awake at night I wipe the sweatfrom my brow But it's not the fear 'cosI'd rather go now Trying to visualize the horrors thatwill lay ahead The desert sand mound a burial ground When it comes to the time Are we partners in crime? When it comes to the time We'll be ready to die God let us go now and finish what'sto be done Thy  Kingdom  Come Thy shall be done... on earth Trying to justify to ourselves thereasons to go Should we live and let live Forget or forgive But how can we let them go on this way? The reign of terror corruption must end And we know deep down there'sno other way No trust, no reasoning, no more to say Afraid to shoot strangers Afraid to shoot strangers"
Dance Of Death,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones About a thing that I saw One night wandering in the evergladesI'd one drink but no more I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight Gazing up at the stars Not aware of a presence so near to me Watching my every move Feeling scared and I fell to my knees As something rushed me from the trees Took me to an unholy place And that is where I fell from grace Then they summoned me over to join in with them To the dance of the dead In to the circle of fire I followed them Into the middle I was led As if time had stopped stillI was numb with fear, but still, I wanted to go And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me As I walked on to the coals Then I felt I was in a trance And my spirit was lifted from me And if only someone had the chance To witness what happened to me And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them All had death in their eyes Lifeless figures they were undead all of them They had ascended from hell As I danced with the dead My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me Below my undead body just danced the circle of death Until the time came to reunite us both My spirit came back down to meI didn't know if I was alive or dead As the others all joined in with me By luck then a skirmish started And took the attention away from me When they took their gaze from me Was the moment that I fled I ran like hell faster than the wind But behind I did not glance One thing that I did not dare Was to look just straight ahead When you know that your time has come around You know you'll be prepared for it Say your last goodbyes to everyone Drink and say a prayer for it When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead To this day I guess I'll never know Just why they let me go But I'll never go dancing no more' Til I dance with the dead"
When The Wild Wind Blows,"Have you heard what they said on the news today Have you heard what is coming to us all? That the world as we know it will be coming to an end Have you heard, have you heard? He sees them in the distance where the darkened clouds roll He can feel tension in the atmosphere He would look in the mirror, see an old man now Doesn't matter they survived somehow They said there's nothing can be done about the situation They said there's nothing you can do at all To sit and wait around for something to occur Did you know, did you know? As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows And wonders if they'll ever grow again The desperation of the situation getting graver Getting ready when the wild wind blows Have you seen what they said on the news today Have you heard what they said about us all Do you know what is happening to just every one of us? Have you heard, have you heard? There will be a catastrophe that like we've never seen There will be something that will light the sky That the world as we know it, it will never be the same Did you know, did you know? He carries everything into the shelter, not a fuss Getting ready when the moment comes He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two Good to have because you never know They tell us nothing that we don't already know about They tell us nothing that is real at all They only fill us with the stuff that they want Did you know, did you know? He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day He's getting tired; that'll do for now They are preparing for the very worst to come to them Getting ready when the wild wind blows He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down Upside down He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face, Saying ""grace"" Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind Left behind And a lifetime spent together long ago Will be gone They've been preparing for some weeks now For when the crucial moment comes To take their refuge in the shelter Let them prepare for what will come They make a tea and sit there waiting They're in the shelter feeling snug Not long to wait for absolution Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait Can't believe all the lying, All the screens are denying That the moments of truth have begun Can't you see it on the t.v.? Don't believe them in the least bit Now the days of our ending have begun Say a prayer when it's all over Survivors unite all as one Got to try and help each other Got the will to overcome I can't believe all the lying, All the screens are denying That the moments of truth have begun Can't you see it on the t.v.? Don't believe them in the least bit Now the days of our ending have begun When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other The tins of poison laying nearby their clothes The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fall out, Just another when the wild wind blows..."

2 Minutes To Midnight,"Kill for gain or shoot to maim But we don't need a reason The  Golden  Goose is on the loose And never out of season. Blackened pride still burns inside This shell of bloody treason Here's my gun for a barrel of fun For the love of living death. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The blind men shout let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers, The  Napalm screams of human flames Of a prime time  Belsen feast... Y E AH! As the reasons for the carnage cut their meatand lick the gravy, We oil the jaws of the war machineand feed it with our babies. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The body bags and little rags of childrentorn in two, And the jellied brains of those who remainto put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us alldance to their song, To the tune of starving millionsto make a better kind of gun. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. Midnight... Midnight... Midnight...is all night Midnight... Midnight... Midnight...is all night."
Revelations,"""O  God of  Earth and  Altar, Bow down and hear our cry, Our earthly rulers falter, Our people drift and die, The walls of gold entomb us, The swords of scorn divide, Take not thy thunder from us, But take away our pride."" Just a babe in a black abyss, No reason for a place like this. The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain. An easy way for the blind to go,A clever path for the fools who know. The  Secret of the  Hangman ­ the smile on his lips. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. She came to me with a serpents kiss, As the  Eye of the  Sun rose on her lips. Moonlight catches silver tears I cry. So we lay in a black embrace, And the  Seed is sown in a holy place, And I watched and I waited for the  Dawn. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. S O LO Bind us all together, Ablaze with  Hope and  Free. No storm or heavy weather, Will rock the boat you'll see. The time has come to close your eyes, And still the wind and rain. For the one who will be  King, Is the watcher in the  Ring. It is  You."
The Trooper,"You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand, there's no turning back The bugle sounds and the charge begins But on this battlefield no one wins The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath As I plunge on into certain death Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh The horse he sweats, with fear, we break to run The mighty roar of the russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the russians fire another round We get so near yet so far away We won't live to fight another day Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We get so close, near enough to fight When a russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger, and I feel the blowA burst of rounds take my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My body's numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear I draw my parting groan Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Wasted Years,"From the coast of gold, across the seven seasI'm travelling on, far and wide But now it seems I'm just a stranger to myself And all the things I sometimes do It isn't me, but someone else I close my eyes, and think of home Another city goes by, in the night Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's gone away And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my dying day So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind Can't ease this pain so easily When you can't find the words to say It's hard to make it through another day And it makes me wanna cry And throw my hands up to the sky So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years"

Can I Play With Madness,"Give me the sense to wonder To wonder if I'm free Give me the sense to wonder To know I can be me Give me the strength, to hold my head up Spit back in their face Don't need no key, to unlock this door Gonna break down the walls Break out of this bad place Can I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball Can I play with madness? There's no vision there at all Can I play with madness? The prophet looked and he laughed at me! Can I play with madness?

Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner See his eyes as he stops one of three Mesmerizes of one of the wedding guests Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea! And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by his spell, and the mariner tells his tale Driven south to the land of the snow and ice To a place where nobody's been Through the snow fog flies on the albatross Hailed in  God's name, hoping good luck it brings And the ship sails on, back to the north Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on The mariner kills the bird of good omen His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves a part of the crime Sailing on and on and north across the sea Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm The albatross begins with its vengeanceA terrible curse, a thirst has begun His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung And the curse goes on and on and on at sea And the thirst goes on and on for them and me Day after day, day after day We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water, everywhere, and all the boards did shrink Water, water, everywhere, not any drop to drink! There - calls the mariner There comes a ship over the line But how can she sail with no Wind in her sails and no tide? See, onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life - wait, but there's two! Death, and she life in death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the mariner And he belongs to her now Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she, life in death She lets him live, her chosen one One after one, by the star dogged moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face, with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down, one by one The curse, it lives on in their eyes The mariner, he wished he'd die Along with the sea creatures But they lived on, so did he And by the light of the moon He prays for their beauty, not doom With heart he blesses them God's creatures, all of them too Then, the spell starts to break The albatross falls from his neck Sinks down like lead, into the sea Then down in falls, comes the rain! Hear the groans of the long dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak, and they're lifeless in their eyes And revenge is still sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on Now the curse is finally lifted And the mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long dead bodies Form their own light and the mariner's left alone And then a boat came sailing towards him It was a joy, he could not believe The pilots boat, his son and the hermit Penance of life will fall onto him And the ship, it sinks, like lead, into the sea And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins The mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell his tale wherever he goes To teach  God's word by his own example That we must love all things that  God made And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man And the tale goes on and on and on"
Powerslave,"Into the  Abyss I'll fall-the eye of  Horus Into the eyes of the night-watching me go Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this  Temple Enter the risen  Osiris-risen again. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death. When I was living this lie- Fear was my game People would worship and fall-drop to their knees. So bring me the blood and red winefor the one to succeed me,for he is a man and a  God-and  He will die too. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on?

Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death, Slave to the  Power of  Death... Slave to the  Power of  Death..."

The Clairvoyant,"Feel the sweat break on my brow Is it me or is it shadows that are Dancing on the walls. Is this a dream or is it now Is this a vision or normality I see Before my eyes. I wonder why, I wonder how That it seems that the power is getting stronger Every dayI feel a strength an inner fire But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore There's a time to live and a time to die When it's time to meet the maker There's a time to live but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying. Just by looking through your eyes He could see the future penetrating right In through you mind See the truth and see your lies But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise There's a time to live and a time to die When it's time to meet the maker There's a time to live but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying......and be reborn again?"
Hallowed Be Thy Name,"I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time' Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole The sands of time for me are running low When the priest comes to read me the last ritesI take a look through the bars at the last sights Of a world that has gone very wrong for me Can it be that there's some sort of error Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream? Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming It's not so easy to stop from screaming But words escape me when I try to speak Tears flow but why am I crying After all I'm not afraid of dying Don't I believe that there never is an end As the guards march me out to the courtyard Somebody cries from a cell:  God be with you If there's a god then why has he let me go? As I walk all my life drifts before me Though the end is near I'm still not sorry Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away Mark my words please believe my soul lives on Please don't worry now that I have goneI've gone beyond to see the truth When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion Hallowed be thy name"

Ghost Of The Navigator,"I have sailed to many lands now I make my final journey On the bow I stand, west is where I go Through the night I plough still my heart calculate and pray As the compass swings my will is strongI will not be led astray Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun But I know, I know I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where I go I do not knowI only know the place I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strainI will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind For eternity I follow on there is no other way Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun But I know, I know"

The blind men shout let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers, The  Napalm screams of human flames Of a prime time  Belsen feast... Y E AH! As the reasons for the carnage cut their meatand lick the gravy, We oil the jaws of the war machineand feed it with our babies.

The body bags and little rags of childrentorn in two, And the jellied brains of those who remainto put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us alldance to their song, To the tune of starving millionsto make a better kind of gun.

Sign Of The Cross,"Eleven saintly shrouded men Silhouettes stand against the sky One in front with a cross held high Come to wash my sins away Standing alone in the wind and rain Feeling the fear that is growing Sensing the change in the tide again Brought by the storm that is brewing Feel the anxiety hold off the fear Some of the doubt in the things you believe Now that your faith will be put to the test Nothing to do but await what is coming Why is then  God still protecting me Even when I don't deserve it? Though I am blessed with an inner strength Some they would call it a penance Why am I meant to face this alone Asking the question time and again Praying to  God won't keep me alive Inside my head feel the fear start to rise...

Killers,"You walk through the subway, His eyes burn a hole in your back.A footstep behind you, He lunges prepared for attack Scream for mercy, He laughs as he's watching you bleed. Killer behind you, His blood lust defies all his needs My innocent victims Are slaughtered with wrath and despise, The mocking religion of hatred That burns in the nightI have no-one,I'm bound to destroy All this greed.A voice inside me, Compelling to satisfy me I can see, What a knife's meant to be. You'll never know, How I came to foresee. My faith in believing is stronger Than lifelines and ties, With the glimmer of metal My moment is ready to strike. The death call arises,A scream breaks the still of the night. Another tomorrow Remember to walk in the light. I have found you, And now there is no place to run. Excitement shakes me, Oh  God help me what have I done. Yeah I've done it again! He walks through the subway My eyes burn a hole through your back.A footstep behind you He lunges prepared for attack. Scream for mercy, He laughs as he's watching you bleed. Killer behind you, My blood lust defies all my needs Look out I'm coming for you!"

Hallowed Be Thy Name,"I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time' Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole The sands of time for me are running low When the priest comes to read me the last ritesI take a look through the bars at the last sights Of a world that has gone very wrong for me Can it be that there's some sort of error Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream? Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming It's not so easy to stop from screaming But words escape me when I try to speak Tears flow but why am I crying After all I'm not afraid of dying Don't I believe that there never is an end As the guards march me out to the courtyard Somebody cries from a cell:  God be with you If there's a god then why has he let me go? As I walk all my life drifts before me Though the end is near I'm still not sorry Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away Mark my words please believe my soul lives on Please don't worry now that I have goneI've gone beyond to see the truth When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion Hallowed be thy name"
Where Eagles Dare,"It's snowing outside, the rumbling sound Of engines roar in the night The mission is near, the confident men Are waiting to drop from the sky The  Blizzard goes on, but still they must fly No one should go where eagles dare Bavarian  Alps that lay all around They seem to stare from below The enemy lines a long time passed Are lying deep in the snow Into the night they fall through the sky No one should fly where eagles dare Their closing in, the fortress is near It's standing high in the sky The cable car's the only way in It's really impossible to climb They make their way, but maybe too late They've got to try to save the day The panicking cries, the roaring of guns Are echoing all around the valley The mission complete, they make to escape Away from the  Eagles  Nest They dared to go where no one would try They chose to fly where eagles dare"
Revelations,"""O  God of  Earth and  Altar, Bow down and hear our cry, Our earthly rulers falter, Our people drift and die, The walls of gold entomb us, The swords of scorn divide, Take not thy thunder from us, But take away our pride."" Just a babe in a black abyss, No reason for a place like this. The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain. An easy way for the blind to go,A clever path for the fools who know. The  Secret of the  Hangman ­ the smile on his lips. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. She came to me with a serpents kiss, As the  Eye of the  Sun rose on her lips. Moonlight catches silver tears I cry. So we lay in a black embrace, And the  Seed is sown in a holy place, And I watched and I waited for the  Dawn. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. S O LO Bind us all together, Ablaze with  Hope and  Free. No storm or heavy weather, Will rock the boat you'll see. The time has come to close your eyes, And still the wind and rain. For the one who will be  King, Is the watcher in the  Ring. It is  You."

Quest For Fire,In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth When the land was swamp and caves were home In an age when prize possession was fire To search for landscapes men would roam Then the tribes they came to steal their fire And the wolves they howled into the night As they fought a vicious angry battle To save the power of warmth and light Drawn by quest for fire They searched all through the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man And they thought that when the embers died away That the flame of life had burnt and died Didn't know the sparks that made the fire Were made by rubbing stick and stone So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts In the search to find another fire To regain the power of light and heat Drawn by quest for fire They searched across the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man Drawn by quest for fire They searched across the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man Drawn by quest for fire They searched across the land Drawn by quest for fire Discovery of man

2 Minutes To Midnight,"Kill for gain or shoot to maim But we don't need a reason The  Golden  Goose is on the loose And never out of season. Blackened pride still burns inside This shell of bloody treason Here's my gun for a barrel of fun For the love of living death. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The blind men shout let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers, The  Napalm screams of human flames Of a prime time  Belsen feast... Y E AH! As the reasons for the carnage cut their meatand lick the gravy, We oil the jaws of the war machineand feed it with our babies.

The body bags and little rags of childrentorn in two, And the jellied brains of those who remainto put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us alldance to their song, To the tune of starving millionsto make a better kind of gun. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb.

Back In The Village,"Turn the spotlights on the people, Switch the dial and eat the worm, Take your chances, kill the engine, Drop your bombs and let it burn. White flags shot to ribbons, The truce is black and burned, Shellshock in the kitchen, Tables overturned. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. Throwing dice now, rolling loaded,I see sixes all the way. In a black hole, and I'm spinning As my wings get shot away. Questions are a burden And answers are a prison for oneself Shellshock in the kitchen Tables start to burn. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. No breaks on the inside, Paper cats and burning barns, Theres a fox among the chickens, And a killer in the hounds. Questions are a burden And answers are a prison for oneself Shellshock in the kitchen Tables start to burn. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. But still we walk into the valley And others try to kill the inner flame We're burning brighter than beforeI don't have a number, I'M A  N A ME! Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. Back in the village again, In the village,I'm back in the village again. Back in the villageI'm back in the villageI'm back in the village again."
Powerslave,"Into the  Abyss I'll fall-the eye of  Horus Into the eyes of the night-watching me go Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this  Temple Enter the risen  Osiris-risen again. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death. When I was living this lie- Fear was my game People would worship and fall-drop to their knees. So bring me the blood and red winefor the one to succeed me,for he is a man and a  God-and  He will die too. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death. Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins, Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone.A shell of a man  God preserved-a thousand ages, But open the gates of my  Hell-I will strike from the grave. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death, Slave to the  Power of  Death... Slave to the  Power of  Death..."
Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner See his eyes as he stops one of three Mesmerizes of one of the wedding guests Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea! And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by his spell, and the mariner tells his tale Driven south to the land of the snow and ice To a place where nobody's been Through the snow fog flies on the albatross Hailed in  God's name, hoping good luck it brings And the ship sails on, back to the north Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on The mariner kills the bird of good omen His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves a part of the crime Sailing on and on and north across the sea Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm The albatross begins with its vengeanceA terrible curse, a thirst has begun His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung And the curse goes on and on and on at sea And the thirst goes on and on for them and me Day after day, day after day We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water, everywhere, and all the boards did shrink Water, water, everywhere, not any drop to drink! There - calls the mariner There comes a ship over the line But how can she sail with no Wind in her sails and no tide? See, onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life - wait, but there's two! Death, and she life in death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the mariner And he belongs to her now Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she, life in death She lets him live, her chosen one One after one, by the star dogged moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face, with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down, one by one The curse, it lives on in their eyes The mariner, he wished he'd die Along with the sea creatures But they lived on, so did he And by the light of the moon He prays for their beauty, not doom With heart he blesses them God's creatures, all of them too Then, the spell starts to break The albatross falls from his neck Sinks down like lead, into the sea Then down in falls, comes the rain! Hear the groans of the long dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak, and they're lifeless in their eyes And revenge is still sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on Now the curse is finally lifted And the mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long dead bodies Form their own light and the mariner's left alone And then a boat came sailing towards him It was a joy, he could not believe The pilots boat, his son and the hermit Penance of life will fall onto him And the ship, it sinks, like lead, into the sea And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins The mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell his tale wherever he goes To teach  God's word by his own example That we must love all things that  God made And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man And the tale goes on and on and on"
Caught Somewhere In Time,"If you had the time to lose, An open mind and time to choose, Would you care to take a look, Or can you read me like a book? Time is always on my side, Time is always on my side. Can I tempt you, come with me, Be  Devil may care, fulfill your dream, If I said I'd take you there, Would you go, would you be scared? Time is always on my side, Time is always on my side. Don't be afraid, you're safe with me, Safe as any soul can be... Honestly, just let yourself go. Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, You try to hide your deepest sins, Of all the things that you've done wrong, And I know where you belong. Time is always on my side, Time is always on my side. Make you an offer you can't refuse, You've only got your soul to lose Eternally...  Let yourself go! Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time Caught now in two minds!"
Wasted Years,"From the coast of gold, across the seven seasI'm travelling on, far and wide But now it seems I'm just a stranger to myself And all the things I sometimes do It isn't me, but someone else I close my eyes, and think of home Another city goes by, in the night Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's gone away And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my dying day So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind Can't ease this pain so easily When you can't find the words to say It's hard to make it through another day And it makes me wanna cry And throw my hands up to the sky So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years"
Sea Of Madness,"Out in the street somebody's crying, Out in the night the fires burn, Maybe tonight somebody's crying, Reached the point of no return. Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe, Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave. Chorus: Like the eagle and the dove, Fly so high on wings above, When all you see can only bring you sadness, Like a river we will flow, On towards the sea we go, When all you do can only bring you sadness, Out on the sea of madness. Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling, Out in the dark there burns a dream, You got to hope when you are falling, To find the world that you have seen. Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe, Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave. Chorus: Like the eagle and the dove, Fly so high on wings above, When all you see can only bring you sadness, Like a river we will flow, On towards the sea we go, When all you do can only bring you sadness, Out on the sea of madness. Solo It's madness, The sun don't shine On the sea of madness, There ain't no wind to fill your sails, Madness, When all you see can only bring you sadness On towards the sea we go Out in the street somebody's crying, Out in the night the fires burn, Maybe tonight somebody's crying, Reached the point of no return.

Deja Vu,"When you see familiar faces, But you don't remember where they're from, Could you be wrong? When you've been particular places, That you know you've never been before, Can you be sure?

( Chorus) Feel like I've been here before, Feel like I've been here before. Feel like I've been here before, Feel like I've been here before. Ever had a conversation, That you realise you've had before, Isn't it strange? Have you ever talked to someone, And you feel you know what's coming next? It feels pre-arranged. ' Cause you know that you've heard it before, And you feel that this moment in time is surreal,' Cause you know when you feel  Deja vu."
Alexander The Great,""" My son, ask for thyself another kingdom, For that which I leave is too small for thee."" Near to the  East, in a part of ancient  Greece, In an ancient land called  Macedonia, Was born a son to  Philip of  Macedon, The legend his name was  Alexander. At the age of nineteen, he became the  Macedon king, And he swore to free all of  Asia  Minor, By the  Aegian  Sea in 334  BC, He utterly beat the armies of  Persia. Chorus: Alexander the  Great, His name struck fear into hearts of men, Alexander the  Great, Became a legend 'mongst mortal men. King  Darius the third,  Defeated fled  Persia, The  Scythians fell by the river  Jaxartes, Then  Egypt fell to the  Macedon king as well, And he founded the city called  Alexandria. By the  Tigris river, he met  King  Darius again, And crushed him again in the battle of  Arbela, Entering  Babylon and  Susa, treasures he found, Took  Persepolis, the capital of  Persia. Chorus: Alexander the  Great, His name struck fear into hearts of men, Alexander the  Great, Became a god amongst mortal men. A  Phrygian  King had bound a chariot yoke, And  Alexander cut the "" Gordion knot"", And legend said that who untied the knot, He would become the master of  Asia. Hellenism he spread far and wide, The  Macedonian learned mind, Their culture was a western way of life, He paved the way for  Christianity. Marching on,  Marching on. The battle weary marching side by side, Alexander's army line by line, They wouldn't follow him to  India, Tired of the combat, pain and the glory. Chorus: Alexander the  Great, His name struck fear into hearts of men, Alexander the  Great, He died of fever in  Babylon."

Infinite Dreams,"Infinite dreams, I can't deny them Infinity is hard to comprehendI couldn't hear those screams Even in my wildest dreams Suffocation waking in a sweat Scared to fall asleep again In case the dream begins again Someone chasing, I cannot move Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue What a dream, when will it end And will I transcend? Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil One nightmare ends, another fertile It's getting to me so scared to sleep But scared to wake now, in too deep Even though its reached new heightsI rather like the restless nights It makes me wonder, it makes me think There's more to this, I'm on the brink It's not the fear of what's beyond It's just that I might not respondI have an interest, almost craving But would I like to get too far in? It can't be all coincidence Too many things are evident You tell me you're an unbeliever Spiritualist?  Well me I'm neither But wouldn't you like to know The truth Of what's out there to have the proof And find out just which side You're on Where would you end in heaven or In hell? Help me!  Help me to find my true Self without seeing the future Save me, save me from torturing Myself even within my dreams There's got to be just more to it Than this Or tell me why do we existI'd like to think that when I dieI'd get a chance, another time And to return and live again Reincarnate, play the game Again and again and again"

The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. The body bags and little rags of childrentorn in two, And the jellied brains of those who remainto put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us alldance to their song, To the tune of starving millionsto make a better kind of gun. The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, Don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight, The hands that threaten doom.2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb. Midnight... Midnight... Midnight...is all night Midnight... Midnight... Midnight...is all night."

Hallowed Be Thy Name,"I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time' Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole The sands of time for me are running low When the priest comes to read me the last ritesI take a look through the bars at the last sights Of a world that has gone very wrong for me Can it be that there's some sort of error Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream? Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming It's not so easy to stop from screaming But words escape me when I try to speak Tears flow but why am I crying After all I'm not afraid of dying Don't I believe that there never is an end As the guards march me out to the courtyard Somebody cries from a cell:  God be with you If there's a god then why has he let me go? As I walk all my life drifts before me Though the end is near I'm still not sorry Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away Mark my words please believe my soul lives on Please don't worry now that I have goneI've gone beyond to see the truth When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion Hallowed be thy name"

The Clairvoyant,"Feel the sweat break on my brow Is it me or is it shadows that are Dancing on the walls. Is this a dream or is it now Is this a vision or normality I see Before my eyes. I wonder why, I wonder how That it seems that the power is getting stronger Every dayI feel a strength an inner fire But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore There's a time to live and a time to die When it's time to meet the maker There's a time to live but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying. Just by looking through your eyes He could see the future penetrating right In through you mind See the truth and see your lies But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise There's a time to live and a time to die When it's time to meet the maker There's a time to live but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying......and be reborn again?"

Sometimes when you're scared to take a look At the corner of the room You've sensed that something's watching you Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a constant fear that something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone's always there Have you ever been alone at night Thought you heard footsteps behind And turned around and no one's there? And as you quicken up your pace You'll find it hard to look again Because you're sure that someone's there Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a constant fear that something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone's always there Fear of the dark Fear of the dark Fear of the dark Fear of the dark Fear of the dark Fear of the dark Fear of the dark Fear of the dark Watching horror films the night before Debating witches and folklores The unknown troubles on your mind Maybe your mind is playing tricks You sense, and suddenly eyes fix On dancing shadows from behind Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have constant fear that something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone's always there Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have constant fear that something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone's always there When I'm walking in a dark roadI am a man who walks alone"

The Trooper,"You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand, there's no turning back The bugle sounds and the charge begins But on this battlefield no one wins The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath As I plunge on into certain death Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh The horse he sweats, with fear, we break to run The mighty roar of the russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the russians fire another round We get so near yet so far away We won't live to fight another day Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh We get so close, near enough to fight When a russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger, and I feel the blowA burst of rounds take my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My body's numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear I draw my parting groan Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Revelations,"""O  God of  Earth and  Altar, Bow down and hear our cry, Our earthly rulers falter, Our people drift and die, The walls of gold entomb us, The swords of scorn divide, Take not thy thunder from us, But take away our pride."" Just a babe in a black abyss, No reason for a place like this. The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain. An easy way for the blind to go,A clever path for the fools who know. The  Secret of the  Hangman ­ the smile on his lips. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. She came to me with a serpents kiss, As the  Eye of the  Sun rose on her lips. Moonlight catches silver tears I cry. So we lay in a black embrace, And the  Seed is sown in a holy place, And I watched and I waited for the  Dawn. The light of the  Blind ­ you'll see, The venom that tears my spine, The  Eyes of the  Nile are opening ­ you'll see. S O LO Bind us all together, Ablaze with  Hope and  Free. No storm or heavy weather, Will rock the boat you'll see. The time has come to close your eyes, And still the wind and rain. For the one who will be  King, Is the watcher in the  Ring. It is  You."
Flight Of Icarus,"As the sun breaks, above the ground An old man stands on the hill As the ground warms, to the first rays of lightA birdsong shatters the still His eyes are ablazed See the madman in his gaze Fly, on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly touch the sun Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears Looks the old man in the eye As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd In the name of  God my father I fly His eyes seem so glazed As he flies on the wings of a dream Now he knows his father betrayed Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave Fly, on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly touch the sun"
Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner See his eyes as he stops one of three Mesmerizes of one of the wedding guests Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea! And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by his spell, and the mariner tells his tale Driven south to the land of the snow and ice To a place where nobody's been Through the snow fog flies on the albatross Hailed in  God's name, hoping good luck it brings And the ship sails on, back to the north Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on The mariner kills the bird of good omen His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves a part of the crime Sailing on and on and north across the sea Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm The albatross begins with its vengeanceA terrible curse, a thirst has begun His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung And the curse goes on and on and on at sea And the thirst goes on and on for them and me Day after day, day after day We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water, everywhere, and all the boards did shrink Water, water, everywhere, not any drop to drink! There - calls the mariner There comes a ship over the line But how can she sail with no Wind in her sails and no tide? See, onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life - wait, but there's two! Death, and she life in death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the mariner And he belongs to her now Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she, life in death She lets him live, her chosen one One after one, by the star dogged moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face, with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down, one by one The curse, it lives on in their eyes The mariner, he wished he'd die Along with the sea creatures But they lived on, so did he And by the light of the moon He prays for their beauty, not doom With heart he blesses them God's creatures, all of them too Then, the spell starts to break The albatross falls from his neck Sinks down like lead, into the sea Then down in falls, comes the rain! Hear the groans of the long dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak, and they're lifeless in their eyes And revenge is still sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on Now the curse is finally lifted And the mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long dead bodies Form their own light and the mariner's left alone And then a boat came sailing towards him It was a joy, he could not believe The pilots boat, his son and the hermit Penance of life will fall onto him And the ship, it sinks, like lead, into the sea And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins The mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell his tale wherever he goes To teach  God's word by his own example That we must love all things that  God made And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man And the tale goes on and on and on"
Powerslave,"Into the  Abyss I'll fall-the eye of  Horus Into the eyes of the night-watching me go Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this  Temple Enter the risen  Osiris-risen again. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death. When I was living this lie- Fear was my game People would worship and fall-drop to their knees. So bring me the blood and red winefor the one to succeed me,for he is a man and a  God-and  He will die too. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid to waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death. Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins, Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone.A shell of a man  God preserved-a thousand ages, But open the gates of my  Hell-I will strike from the grave. Tell me why I had to be a  PowerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a  God,why can't I live on? When the  Life  Giver dies,all around is laid waste. And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the  Power of  Death, Slave to the  Power of  Death... Slave to the  Power of  Death..."

Killers,"You walk through the subway, His eyes burn a hole in your back.A footstep behind you, He lunges prepared for attack Scream for mercy, He laughs as he's watching you bleed. Killer behind you, His blood lust defies all his needs My innocent victims Are slaughtered with wrath and despise, The mocking religion of hatred That burns in the nightI have no-one,I'm bound to destroy All this greed.A voice inside me, Compelling to satisfy me I can see, What a knife's meant to be. You'll never know, How I came to foresee. My faith in believing is stronger Than lifelines and ties, With the glimmer of metal My moment is ready to strike. The death call arises,A scream breaks the still of the night. Another tomorrow Remember to walk in the light. I have found you, And now there is no place to run. Excitement shakes me, Oh  God help me what have I done. Yeah I've done it again! He walks through the subway My eyes burn a hole through your back.A footstep behind you He lunges prepared for attack. Scream for mercy, He laughs as he's watching you bleed. Killer behind you, My blood lust defies all my needs Look out I'm coming for you!"
